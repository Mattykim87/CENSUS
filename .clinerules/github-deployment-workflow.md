## Brief overview
This set of guidelines outlines the workflow for project completion and GitHub deployment, specifying the steps to follow when a task is completed within this project.

## Task completion workflow
- When a task is completed, always ask if the user wants to deploy the project to GitHub
- Use a clear, direct question like "Would you like me to deploy this project to GitHub?"
- Wait for an explicit "YES" confirmation before proceeding with GitHub deployment

## GitHub deployment process
- Only proceed with GitHub deployment after receiving explicit confirmation
- If user confirms with "YES", initialize the repository and push to GitHub
- Include setting up a proper .gitignore file before deployment
- Configure appropriate GitHub-specific settings (branch protection, etc.) if requested

## User confirmation requirements
- Require explicit "YES" confirmation - do not proceed with ambiguous responses
- If confirmation is not provided, acknowledge and await further instructions
- Provide a summary of what will be deployed before requesting confirmation

## Alternative deployment options
- If the user declines GitHub deployment, offer alternative options if appropriate
- Present other deployment platforms mentioned in the project documentation
- Maintain the current local-only state if no deployment is requested
